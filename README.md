+ Pros:
   Friendly syntaxes as the goal for this Project.
   Users can easily add as many hidden layers and neurons as desired.
   Available activation functions: ReLU, Sigmoid, TanH, Identity.
- Cons:
   High additions on hidden layer and/or neuron may lead to exhausting Runtime.


II. JoyBillv2 is the version supercharged by a Very Unique Approach of Optimization, completed on Feb 20, 2024.
 + New features:
   Sequential Batch Gradient Descent(SBGD), now is able to boost the Training Speed substantially.
   Users can use function 'describe()' to see description of their Neural Networks.
